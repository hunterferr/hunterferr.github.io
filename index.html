    <h2>My teammates</h2>
    <p>A haiku to my teammates in video games who cannot accept that there will be times that we are just worse at the
        game:</p>
    <p>It is not our fault<br> Sometimes they are just better<br> It will be alright<br></p>
    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>One of the things I am interested in is video games. I enjoy all kinds of video games from strategy to shooters.
        I also occasionaly watch competitive League of Legends. </p>
    <p>Another thing I am interested in is reading. I have always liked reading since I waas little. I primarily like
        fantasy books, but also like to read about history.</p>
    <p>The last thing I am interested in is football. Football is really the only sport I watch. I have played football
        since I was 10, and always like to watch NFL games on Sunday.</p>
